New Life Sydney

We are a community of Christians in Sydney ranging from university students, vocational workers and young families that gather, ‘for the glory of God, in the Gospel of Grace.’

This github branch is a project I have been working on for the church's praise team. It allows the user to search for songs, artists, members, rosters and past Sundays for the Praise Team members. It also shows which songs we have done the most and which songs we have done the least. The user can add and edit new Sundays with songs, passage and sermon titles and also add new rosters into the PostgreSQL Database and it will be linked to the Flask server which will be running on AWS when this project is completed.
